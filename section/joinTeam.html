  <p>We are still in the process of creation!<br>
    As part of our web developer studies, we decided to join forces to create an MMO video game.<br>
    The passion and love for video games brought us together and to carry out this project we are looking for at least
    <ul>
      <li>2 designers (for the site and for the game itself)</li>
      <li>1 or 2 level designers (takes care of the creation of the map)</li>
      <li>1 sound technician (sound is very important in a game</li>
