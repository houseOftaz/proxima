        <p>A fantastic story with realistic bases.<br><br>
          Our game takes place in the future.<br><br>
          Following the monetary collapse, the world gradually sinks into chaos:<br>
          men are tearing the last resources apart, the conquest of space has become the priority for preserve human life, the Earth is seen more and more hostile and abandoned for space stations and the colonies of the Moon and Mars.<br><br>
          As a last hope, a space colony mission is deployed to the star system and planets closest to Earth within the Milky Way: Alpha Centauri, in the constellation Centaur.<br>
          In orbit of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, Proxima C was classified in the 2000s as cold super-Earth type exoplanet, which was the ideal destination for the "Last Hope" colony.<br>
          Indeed, according to the observations of Hubble, developed by NASA around 1990, Proxima is attributed basic properties similar to Earth, such as rock, hydrogen, carbon ...<br><br>
          After mastering fission and many other technologies around 2025, the journey of many light years was reduced to 70 years.<br>
          The colony of 110 embryos, minimum numbers necessary for successful repopulation, is managed by a AI developed especially for travel.<br><br>
          1) Arrived at its destination, the shuttle is teleported to the humans whose education was designed for young people a twenty years before their arrival on Proxima.<br>
          2) Arrived at its destination, the shuttle sees the release of 'cocoons' carrying the young humans whose education was it twenty years before their arrival on Proxima.<br><br>
          Starting map: you will start the adventure with nothing, it's up to you to create your tools and armor!
